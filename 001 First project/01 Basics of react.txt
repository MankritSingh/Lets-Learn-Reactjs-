What is react??  
React calls itself a javascript library that allows us to create interfaces.Interfaces are the basic building block of react.
React allows us 1)Display HTML 2)Dyanmically change that HTMl
So we can create and display HTML according to our logic and change the html,which is basically the view of the application
based on user input,some logic,etc.

JSX
it is javascript XML.It allows us to write HTML and Javascript together.This is done with the intention of having logic and UI work along to some extent.
